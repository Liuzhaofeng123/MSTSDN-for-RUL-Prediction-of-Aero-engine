Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is crucial for simplifying maintenance procedures and extending the lifespan 
of aero-engine. Therefore, exploration on RUL prediction models for aero-engine is increasingly gaining attention. 
To this end, the author design and build a deep neural network based on multi-scale feature extraction, named Multi-Scale Temporal-Spatial 
feature-based hybrid Deep neural Network (MSTSDN). And the experiments were conducted by using two aero-engine datasets, 
namely C-MAPSS and N-CMAPSS, to evaluate RUL prediction performance of MSTSDN. The repository contains the datasets 
used, the code to construct MSTSDN, and the code to train and test the model.
